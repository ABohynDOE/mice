\title{Jamshidian and Jalal's Non-Parametric MCAR Test}
\usage{
MCAR(
  x,
  imputed = mice(x, method = "pmm"),
  min_n = floor(0.05 * nrow(x)),
  method = "Auto",
  replications = 10000,
  use_chisq = 30,
  alpha = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object for which a method exists; usually a `data.frame`.}

\item{imputed}{Either an object of class `mids`, as returned by [mice::mice],
or a list of `data.frame`s.}

\item{min_n}{Atomic numeric. When there are missing data patterns with
fewer than `min_n` cases, all cases with that pattern will be removed from
`x` and `imputed`.}

\item{method}{Atomic character. If it is known (or assumed) that data are
either multivariate normally distributed or not, then use either
`method = "hawkins"` or `method = "nonparametric"`, respectively.
The default argument `method = "auto"` follows the procedure outlined in the
Details section, and in Figure 7 of Jamshidian and Jalal (2010).}

\item{replications}{Number of replications used to simulate the Neyman
distribution when performing Hawkins' test. As this method is based on random
sampling, use a high number of `replications` (and optionally, `set.seed()`)
to minimize Monte Carlo error and ensure reproducibility.}

\item{use_chisq}{Atomic integer, indicating the minimum number of cases
within a group *k* that triggers the use of asymptotic Chi-square
distribution instead of the emprical distribution in the Neyman uniformity
test, which is performed as part of Hawkins' test.}

\item{alpha}{Atomic numeric, indicating the significance level of tests.}
}
\value{
An object of class `mcar_object`.
}
\description{
Test whether the missing data mechanism is contingent upon the observed
variables,
according to the methodology developed by Jamshidian and Jalal (2010) (see
Details).
}
\details{
Three types of missingness have been distinguished in the literature
(Rubin, 1976):
Missing completely at random (MCAR), which means that missingness is random;
missing at random (MAR), which means that missingness is contingent on the
*observed*;
and missing not at random (MNAR), which means that missingness is related to
unobserved data.

Jamshidian and Jalal's non-parametric MCAR test assumes that, if data are
not MAR, the covariance matrices of the imputed data will be equal accross
groups with different patterns of missingness. This assumption is tested
using the following procedure:
\enumerate{
  \item Data are imputed.
  \item The imputed data are split into *k* groups according to the *k*
  missing data patterns in the original data (see [mice::md.pattern].
  \item Perform Hawkins' test for equality of covariances across the *k*
  groups.
  \item If the test is *not significant*, conclude that there is no evidence
  against multivariate normality of the data, nor against MCAR.
  \item If the test *is significant*, and multivariate normality of the data
  can be assumed, then it can be concluded that missingness is MAR.
  \item If multivariate normality cannot be assumed, then perform the
  Anderson-Darling non-parametric test for equality of covariances across the
  *k* groups.
  \item If the Anderson-Darling test is *not significant*, this is evidence
  against multivariate normality - but no evidence against MCAR.
  \item If the Anderson-Darling test *is significant*, this is evidence
  it can be concluded that missingness is MAR.
}

Note that, despite its name in common parlance, an MCAR test can only
indicate whether missingness is MAR versus non-MAR.
A non-significant MCAR test cannot distinguish between MCAR or MNAR.

This is a re-implementation of the function `TestMCARNormality`, which was
originally published in the R-packgage `MissMech`, which has been removed
from CRAN. This new implementation is faster, as its backend is written in
C++. It also enhances the functionality of the original:
\itemize{
  \item Multiply imputed data can now be used; the median p-value and test
  statistic across replications is then reported, as suggested by
  Eekhout, Wiel, and Heymans (2017).
  \item The printing method for an `mcar_object` gives a warning when at
  least one p-value of either test was significant. In this case, it is
  recommended to inspect the range of p-values, and consider potential
  violations of MCAR.
  \item A plotting method for an `mcar_object` is provided.
  \item A plotting method for the `$md.pattern` element of an `mcar_object`
  is provided.
